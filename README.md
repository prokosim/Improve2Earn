## Storyboard
### Reporter's perspective
1. Reporter spots a nasty place in his/her neighbourhood
2. Reporter takes a photo and upload a new Problem to IPFS
3. A couple of Proponents come with a Solutions to it
4. The community of Apporovers chooses the best Solution (Snapshot)
5. The Proponent is then called to action to realize the solution
6. The Proponent uploads photos of the solution
7. The community of Apporovers decides on quality of the solution (Snapshot)

### Proponent's perspective
1. Browsing through Problems of her/his own neighbourhood finds a doable one
2. Makes a proposal of own Solution to it (with budget???)
3. Waits if it gets elected by the community
4. 

### Approver's perspective
1. Browsing through Solutions of her/his own neighbourhood finds an interesting one
2.
